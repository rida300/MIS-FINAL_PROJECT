August 09, 2016

The atrocity of organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners in China is meeting strong opposition from the public. Recent reports from Ireland, Finland, and Austria and detailed below.

Ireland: More than 7,000 Signatures
Over 7,000 signatures have been collected in Ireland since July 2015 to support lawsuits against former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin for persecuting Falun Gong, and condemning the organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners in China.

Falun Gong practitioners give out information at Grafton Street in Dublin on July 30, 2016.

One Irish resident said, ""I have watched a documentary on this. It [forced organ harvesting] is horrible and it must stop.""

A pedestrian signs a petition.

Summer is the peak of tourist season in Ireland. Many buses of Chinese tourists arrive from Britain to Ireland every day, as the last shopping stop before returning to China. Upon arriving at Grafton Street in Dublin, one of the well-known shopping streets in Ireland, many of them saw the booth set up by Falun Gong practitioners. Some were surprised, some watched the peaceful meditation, and some nodded at practitioners or agreed to renounce their Communist Party memberships for its persecution of Falun Gong.

Mr. Zhang, one of the tour guides, has lived in Britain for nearly 20 years. After talking with practitioners and learning about the severe suppression in China, he signed a petition to support practitioners, and said that Jiang should be brought to justice for his crimes.

In July 2013, the Irish Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade conducted a hearing and unanimously passed a motion which called on the Irish Government to support the UN and Council of Europe initiatives to oppose forced organ harvesting in China.

There a millions of people outside walking trough our Society with a brain damage, most of them
are even in power or charge of our governments, hospitals, armys etc.
That¬¥s Insane!!!
They enjoy to hurt people it shows in their brains. (Ventral Striatum)
Psychopaths have reduced gray matter in the paralimbic system of the brain.
They brains have a different form and structure.
A psychopath is classically defined as a person with an extreme inability to empathize with other
human beings. They also lack remorse for their actions, will comfortably exploit others for their
own personal gain, and have a high level of self‚Äêconfidence.
As well as over‚Äêvaluing the reward signals from the ventral striatum, a recent Harvard study found
that people with psychopathy are unable to accurately evaluate the future consequences of their
actions.
""The way that capitalism is structured really is a physical manifestation of the brain anomaly known
as psychopathy,"" Ronson said in an interview back in 2011 while promoting his exceptional book
The Psychopath Test.
When we look at History we can see how they treated humanity.
They killed, raped, lied, manipulated, sended us into wars..... Why dont we search for a cure of this
sickness? Serious?
Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Harold Shipman, Anders Berhing Breivik, Ted Bundy, Leonarda Cianculli
even more
And we are not talking of these "" Prosocial"" Psychopaths that trade with food to raise the prices
because they give nothing and because of that people in Africa and in other parts of the world are
dying of hunger, or the mental games they are ""playing"" with us so we do what they want. The daily
abuse of women in relationships.
We have to do something now!
With our society to reward the type of behavior of psychopathics, it is no surprise that some studies
have found that up to one in five corporate professionals display ""clinically significant psychopathic
traits"".
Traitments could be:
Searching for a cure with scientists and doctors.
Genemodification: MAO‚ÄêA, CDH 13
When we cure Psychopathy we are gonna live in a whole new peacfull and better World.

The GOVERNMENT CONTROLS AND ACCESSES OUR BRAIN AND IT'S MEMORY AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE THINK AT ALL TIMES AS OUR BRAINS ARE SYNCED AND CAN MANIPULATE OUR BRAINS AND NEURONS IN IT , either American government or the Soviet has implanted a technology in almost every humans brain that can read what you think and transmit it to them and can alter what and when you think and can programme your brain. They know exactly what we think and at what time   AND can ERASE ENTIRE MEMORY AND REWRITE THEIR OWN MEMORY TO MAKE MULTIPLE COPIES OF THEIR BRAIN IMPLANTED IN YOU.T His technologies were developed during cold war, IT IS A TECHNOLOGY KEPT SECRET BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT OF USA AND SOVIET POSESSES BRAIN CONTROL AND BRAIN MEMORY READING AND BRAIN SYNCHRONISATION TECHNOLOGIES, READ PROJECT MK ULTRA OR SOVIET BRAIN CONTROL PROGRAMS , THEY HAVE A NON METAL GADGET OF BRAIN INTERFACE WHICH TRANSFERS EACH AND EVERY NEURON SIGNAL ALONG WITH ITS MAPPING TO THE GOVERNMENT SECRET TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE CENTERS.  Read about project Mkultra and Soviet mind control programs on Google why has the whole world been silent about science related to brains for past century when it has been proposed in 1880s that ""man is a machine"". Government preserves all the data of our brain and genes and DNA and keeps and uses our artificial copy of brains on a chip for further scientific advances.They never forget anything as their memory is kept permanent and have additional memory implanted in The brains . They even have bionic technologies for brain related things such as extra memory and other electron to neuron converters. Google Project Mk ultra and Soviet brain control programmes in the 1950s and 1970s even the Germans conducted such experiments on controlling brain and reading and storing and transmitting what's in brains.The Frankenstein was based on real experiments by scientists. I am telling all this by a first hand experienced they interfered with my dreams just like the movie inception which might have been inspired by such government technologies I wonder why they didn't erase this knowledge from my neuronic brain memory .And Schizophrenia is a made up disease by the Government , see how all schizophrenics think that someone is reading their thoughts? It's because of this technology that the govt is using to actually do this, think about it, think of all the governments secret experiments during the 1900s , Think about it isn't this technology very practical since human brain is nothing but neuron computer.?",2018-04-13 14:14:28,0

The screening was sponsored by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

Two themes in the film highlight the persecution of Falun Gong in China: forced organ harvesting and Internet censorship.

The premiere of The Bleeding Edge in Washington D.C. on December 14

In the early 2000s, the increasing spread of information technology was quickly becoming a perceived threat to the Chinese communist regime. Western technology companies were paid large sums to develop a high-profile project dubbed ""The Golden Shield Project,"" aimed at censoring and restricting Internet access as well as monitoring the activities of Chinese citizens.

In the film, when a young Western technology executive based in China suffers a heart failure on the job, he receives a heart transplant from an unknown donor. Once he discovers the horrific truth behind his operation, he must risk his life to help save the next victims and find redemption.

Director Leon Lee told the audience after the screening that 90% of the content is based on the real-life events in China; the experiences of the protagonist, a young female Falun Gong practitioner, were taken from many victims' true stories.

Marion Smith, the chair of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, praised the cast's performances. He said the American people should pay attention to forced organ harvesting and other human rights violations in China.

Smith added that the U.S-China relationship should be based on these truths, and that human rights is an indispensable component that the new American administration must deal with.

The audience included congressional staffers, think-tank scholars, and reporters.

Quinn Nii, an Asian-Pacific American activist engaged in building bridges between the East and West, said, ""I am glad the premiere has drawn attention from media ‚Ä¶ I believe many people are concerned about the violence and the persecution of beliefs in China.""

The Bleeding Edge has been screened at the British Parliament and the Vancouver Asian Film Festival. It won the 51st Gabriel Award in June 2016.",2018-04-20 01:14:31,0

The GOVERNMENT CONTROLS AND ACCESSES OUR BRAIN AND IT'S MEMORY AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE THINK AT ALL TIMES AS OUR BRAINS ARE SYNCED AND CAN MANIPULATE OUR BRAINS AND NEURONS IN IT , either American government or the Soviet has implanted a technology in almost every humans brain that can read what you think and transmit it to them and can alter what and when you think and can programme your brain. They know exactly what we think and at what time   AND can ERASE ENTIRE MEMORY AND REWRITE THEIR OWN MEMORY TO MAKE MULTIPLE COPIES OF THEIR BRAIN IMPLANTED IN YOU.T His technologies were developed during cold war, IT IS A TECHNOLOGY KEPT SECRET BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT OF USA AND SOVIET POSESSES BRAIN CONTROL AND BRAIN MEMORY READING AND BRAIN SYNCHRONISATION TECHNOLOGIES, READ PROJECT MK ULTRA OR SOVIET BRAIN CONTROL PROGRAMS , THEY HAVE A NON METAL GADGET OF BRAIN INTERFACE WHICH TRANSFERS EACH AND EVERY NEURON SIGNAL ALONG WITH ITS MAPPING TO THE GOVERNMENT SECRET TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE CENTERS.  Read about project Mkultra and Soviet mind control programs on Google why has the whole world been silent about science related to brains for past century when it has been proposed in 1880s that ""man is a machine"". Government preserves all the data of our brain and genes and DNA and keeps and uses our artificial copy of brains on a chip for further scientific advances.They never forget anything as their memory is kept permanent and have additional memory implanted in The brains . They even have bionic technologies for brain related things such as extra memory and other electron to neuron converters. Google Project Mk ultra and Soviet brain control programmes in the 1950s and 1970s even the Germans conducted such experiments on controlling brain and reading and storing and transmitting what's in brains.The Frankenstein was based on real experiments by scientists. I am telling all this by a first hand experienced they interfered with my dreams just like the movie inception which might have been inspired by such government technologies I wonder why they didn't erase this knowledge from my neuronic brain memory .And Schizophrenia is a made up disease by the Government , see how all schizophrenics think that someone is reading their thoughts? It's because of this technology that the govt is using to actually do this, think about it, think of all the governments secret experiments during the 1900s , Think about it isn't this technology very practical since human brain is nothing but neuron computer.?",2018-04-13 14:14:36,0

At first I was a bit disappointed as well but after thinking about it I actually liked it more and more. It is a different kind of a war film, not the ""Saving private Ryan"" type. I think it achieved what it tried to do. And I think it is a great movie.

It may not have had any outstanding acting displays, or a unique and thrilling plot (like TDK, Inception etc), but it certainly cannot be compared to these films in a negative light. 

Dunkirk is one of the most immersive portrayals of war that film has ever seen, and while it may lack the glamour that some of his other films have (which imo is much easier to produce, and tends to appeal to a more shallow audience group), it compensates for this with its purely unique style, and its ability to create suspense and maintain it (without the use of fluffy dialogue).

Get to know about all aspects of film, not just DiCaprio exploring a dream world - (Inception and TDK are two of my favourite films, but Dunkirk CANNOT be disregarded!!!)",2018-01-24 07:28:41,13

The GOVERNMENT CONTROLS AND ACCESSES OUR BRAIN AND IT'S MEMORY AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE THINK AT ALL TIMES AS OUR BRAINS ARE SYNCED AND CAN MANIPULATE OUR BRAINS AND NEURONS IN IT , either American government or the Soviet has implanted a technology in almost every humans brain that can read what you think and transmit it to them and can alter what and when you think and can programme your brain. They know exactly what we think and at what time   AND can ERASE ENTIRE MEMORY AND REWRITE THEIR OWN MEMORY TO MAKE MULTIPLE COPIES OF THEIR BRAIN IMPLANTED IN YOU.T His technologies were developed during cold war, IT IS A TECHNOLOGY KEPT SECRET BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT OF USA AND SOVIET POSESSES BRAIN CONTROL AND BRAIN MEMORY READING AND BRAIN SYNCHRONISATION TECHNOLOGIES, READ PROJECT MK ULTRA OR SOVIET BRAIN CONTROL PROGRAMS , THEY HAVE A NON METAL GADGET OF BRAIN INTERFACE WHICH TRANSFERS EACH AND EVERY NEURON SIGNAL ALONG WITH ITS MAPPING TO THE GOVERNMENT SECRET TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE CENTERS.  Read about project Mkultra and Soviet mind control programs on Google why has the whole world been silent about science related to brains for past century when it has been proposed in 1880s that ""man is a machine"". Government preserves all the data of our brain and genes and DNA and keeps and uses our artificial copy of brains on a chip for further scientific advances.They never forget anything as their memory is kept permanent and have additional memory implanted in The brains . They even have bionic technologies for brain related things such as extra memory and other electron to neuron converters. Google Project Mk ultra and Soviet brain control programmes in the 1950s and 1970s even the Germans conducted such experiments on controlling brain and reading and storing and transmitting what's in brains.The Frankenstein was based on real experiments by scientists. I am telling all this by a first hand experienced they interfered with my dreams just like the movie inception which might have been inspired by such government technologies I wonder why they didn't erase this knowledge from my neuronic brain memory .And Schizophrenia is a made up disease by the Government , see how all schizophrenics think that someone is reading their thoughts? It's because of this technology that the govt is using to actually do this, think about it, think of all the governments secret experiments during the 1900s , Think about it isn't this technology very practical since human brain is nothing but neuron computer.?",2018-04-13 14:15:03,0

The GOVERNMENT CONTROLS AND ACCESSES OUR BRAIN AND IT'S MEMORY AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE THINK AT ALL TIMES AS OUR BRAINS ARE SYNCED AND CAN MANIPULATE OUR BRAINS AND NEURONS IN IT , either American government or the Soviet has implanted a technology in almost every humans brain that can read what you think and transmit it to them and can alter what and when you think and can programme your brain. They know exactly what we think and at what time   AND can ERASE ENTIRE MEMORY AND REWRITE THEIR OWN MEMORY TO MAKE MULTIPLE COPIES OF THEIR BRAIN IMPLANTED IN YOU.THis technologies were developed during cold war, IT IS A TECHNOLOGY KEPT SECRET BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT OF USA AND SOVIET POSESSES BRAIN CONTROL AND BRAIN MEMORY READING AND BRAIN SYNCHRONISATION TECHNOLOGIES, READ PROJECT MK ULTRA OR SOVIET BRAIN CONTROL PROGRAMS , THEY HAVE A NON METAL GADGET OF BRAIN INTERFACE WHICH TRANSFERS EACH AND EVERY NEURON SIGNAL ALONG WITH ITS MAPPING TO THE GOVERNMENT SECRET TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE CENTERS.  Read about project Mkultra and Soviet mind control programs on Google why has the whole world been silent about science related to brains for past century when it has been proposed in 1880s that ""man is a machine"". Government preserves all the data of our brain and genes and DNA and keeps and uses our artificial copy of brains on a chip for further scientific advances.They never forget anything as their memory is kept permanent and have additional memory implanted in The brains . They even have bionic technologies for brain related things such as extra memory and other electron to neuron converters. Google Project Mk ultra and Soviet brain control programmes in the 1950s and 1970s even the Germans conducted such experiments on controlling brain and reading and storing and transmitting what's in brains.The Frankenstein was based on real experiments by scientists. I am telling all this by a first hand experienced they interfered with my dreams just like the movie inception which might have been inspired by such government technologies I wonder why they didn't erase this knowledge from my neuronic brain memory .And Schizophrenia is a made up disease by the Government , see how all schizophrenics think that someone is reading their thoughts? It's because of this technology that the govt is using to actually do this, think about it, think of all the governments secret experiments during the 1900s , Think about it isn't this technology very practical since human brain is nothing but neuron computer.?",2018-04-13 14:15:54,0

It's the only time in the film Cobb does not get to spin his totem completely to see if he is still in the dream since Saito interrupts him. From that point on he keeps going deeper and deeper. When he does finally wake up in real life he will be back at the planning stage of the Inception job. (I smell a sequel) Cobb's kids also support my theory. In the beginning when he hears his children on the phone, their voices are a lot older than how we see them throughout the film as his projections. (His projections are the same young kids that are at the end of the film, wearing the exact same clothes). You can also see in the credits there were two sets of kids playing Cobb's children at different ages. Why would that be if we see the same children throughout the movie ? I've heard the wedding ring theory but still always go back to that scene waking up from the sedative and that totem not fully spinning. Anyone else agree ?",2017-12-14 15:23:14,9

That's also why the the result of whether or not the top stops spinning at the end isn't shown. 

It wasn't about whether or not Cobb was in a dream, it was about letting go of the idea that he has control over it.

Cobb walked away without even bothering to glance at the top when he heard his kids voices, hence the final transformation was made for him to finally stop caring about the ""dream world"".",2017-12-14 20:20:25,0

The GOVERNMENT CONTROLS AND ACCESSES OUR BRAIN AND IT'S MEMORY AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE THINK AT ALL TIMES AS OUR BRAINS ARE SYNCED AND CAN MANIPULATE OUR BRAINS AND NEURONS IN IT , either American government or the Soviet has implanted a technology in almost every humans brain that can read what you think and transmit it to them and can alter what and when you think and can programme your brain. They know exactly what we think and at what time   AND can ERASE ENTIRE MEMORY AND REWRITE THEIR OWN MEMORY TO MAKE MULTIPLE COPIES OF THEIR BRAIN IMPLANTED IN YOU.T His technologies were developed during cold war, IT IS A TECHNOLOGY KEPT SECRET BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT OF USA AND SOVIET POSESSES BRAIN CONTROL AND BRAIN MEMORY READING AND BRAIN SYNCHRONISATION TECHNOLOGIES, READ PROJECT MK ULTRA OR SOVIET BRAIN CONTROL PROGRAMS , THEY HAVE A NON METAL GADGET OF BRAIN INTERFACE WHICH TRANSFERS EACH AND EVERY NEURON SIGNAL ALONG WITH ITS MAPPING TO THE GOVERNMENT SECRET TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE CENTERS.  Read about project Mkultra and Soviet mind control programs on Google why has the whole world been silent about science related to brains for past century when it has been proposed in 1880s that ""man is a machine"". Government preserves all the data of our brain and genes and DNA and keeps and uses our artificial copy of brains on a chip for further scientific advances.They never forget anything as their memory is kept permanent and have additional memory implanted in The brains . They even have bionic technologies for brain related things such as extra memory and other electron to neuron converters. Google Project Mk ultra and Soviet brain control programmes in the 1950s and 1970s even the Germans conducted such experiments on controlling brain and reading and storing and transmitting what's in brains.The Frankenstein was based on real experiments by scientists. I am telling all this by a first hand experienced they interfered with my dreams just like the movie inception which might have been inspired by such government technologies I wonder why they didn't erase this knowledge from my neuronic brain memory .And Schizophrenia is a made up disease by the Government , see how all schizophrenics think that someone is reading their thoughts? It's because of this technology that the govt is using to actually do this, think about it, think of all the governments secret experiments during the 1900s , Think about it isn't this technology very practical since human brain is nothing but neuron computer.?",2018-04-13 14:14:11,0

Fact Check History
Is 'Snowflake' a Nazi Term for the Remains of Cremated Victims?
A persistent rumor holds that the term ""snowflake"" originated during the Holocaust, but no evidence backs up this claim.

CLAIM
""Snowflake"" was a Nazi term used to describe the remains of those who were incinerated during the Holocaust.

RATING
FALSE
ORIGIN
In November 2016, the Collin's Dictionary included the term ""snowflake generation"" as one of its top ten words of the year (although technically, this is a phrase, not a word). It came with the following definition:

noun: the young adults of the 2010s, viewed as being less resilient and more prone to taking offence than previous generations
Not long afterward, internet rumors appeared asserting that the etymology of the word ""snowflake"" (at least, as a semi-pejorative term rather than the politically neutral word for an an actual flake of snow) actually dates back to World War II, when it was used by Nazi soldiers to refer to the human remains of people who were incinerated in crematoriums",2017-12-05 13:04:57,7
